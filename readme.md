This simple app was created as a class assignment in Hack University's JavaScript Foundations class. It calls on an API offered through Oregon State Parks that returns information on upcoming events. A user can search for a term and any matching events will be displayed.

Mostly just testing API access, but a little useful! Can be accessed at http://tyreer.com/parks.html
